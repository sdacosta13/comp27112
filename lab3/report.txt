1.) Is Otsuâ€™s method successful in thresholding all the images?
Otsu's method is successful in thresholding some of the images but not all.
The motorway image has been separated between foreground and background quite effectively.
Using Otu's method on glaucoma.jpg shows that most of the blood vessels are mis-classified
This is the same for the optic nerve head and the fundus images.
I think this is because the lighting for all of the nerve and eye images is less uniform then the motorway image.
The thresholding seems to focus on the lighter areas

2.) How would you modify the thresholding algorithm to address any problems?
Otsu's method works well, however it does not work for images with bad lighting.
A solution would be to apply the thresholding algorithm to subsections of the image and then combine the results.
This solves the uniformity issue, as if you take a subsection then the differences in lighting are much lower in the subsection than in the whole image

3.) What metrics are there for assessing the success of thresholding?
There are not many, as unless you have an output you wish to achieve, assessing the success is very difficult.
Thresholding can be applied to solve many different problems, and to seperate different objects in an image, but until you know what you want to be seperating,
then you measure how well it is doing. A solution to this is having a golden output to compare to, and measuring the success by calculating the mean squared error.
However often, a golden output cannot be known.
